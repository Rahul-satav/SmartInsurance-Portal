SmartInsurance Portal – 3 Minute Demo Script

1) Intro (10s)
Hi, I’m Rahul. This is SmartInsurance Portal – a full-stack insurance demo with Angular UI, Spring Boot microservices, MySQL, JWT auth, PDF+QR, and a live GitHub Pages frontend.

2) Architecture (20s)
Frontend is static on GitHub Pages. It talks to a hosted Spring Boot backend via an API gateway. We have services for Auth, Policy, Document, and Admin metrics. PDFs include QR that resolves to a verify endpoint.

3) Login (20s)
Open Login, use user@demo.com / User@1234. Token is stored in localStorage and passed as Authorization: Bearer headers.

4) Calculator (45s)
Choose vehicle type, age, city tier, liability, and NCB. Click “Get Quote.” You’ll see vehicle premium, liability, GST, and total. Click “Buy Policy” to issue – we get a policyId, download PDF, and see a QR to verify publicly.

5) Dashboard (30s)
As a logged-in user, view total users, policies, and total premium. Show bar chart for policies by type.

6) Policies (15s)
List of your issued policies. Open PDF and verify.

7) Wrap (15s)
Deployed frontend on GitHub Pages, backend on Spring Boot + MySQL. Clean code, scalable microservices, and clear demo storytelling.
